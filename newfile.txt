The ADD command takes the current state of all the files in the remote repository, either new files added to the local repo or modifications and changes made to existing files, and sends it to a "staging area" which acts as a buffer zone before the changes are locked in and combined with the main repo while the COMMIT command takes the current state of the "staging area" and locks them in so that they can join the main repo. The term itself defines what the command does since the term commit means to pledge or bind to a certain course or policy, being similar to the action it does within git. Usually accompanied with a commit message that acts as the description of the changes made and is imperative in keeping the repo readable and easy to maintain. This command only locks the changes in and does not apply them automatically until the push command is called. Lastly, the PUSH command takes the committed changes and combines them with the main repo, effectively applying all the changes and additions made so that anyone with access to the main repo has the opportunity to retrieve the changes and apply them to their local repos, usually by invoking the PULL command.
